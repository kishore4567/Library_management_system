# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  

## ðŸ”Š Overview:  

The Library Management System is a full-stack web application designed to help libraries efficiently manage their books, users, and borrowing activities. With a clean, user-friendly interface, librarians can easily add books, track borrowed and returned books, and manage user accounts. The system provides insightful visualizations, such as book availability and borrowing trends, to help librarians make data-driven decisions. Additionally, users can search for books, check availability, and request book loans, ensuring a seamless library experience.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective:  

The objective of the Library Management System project is to create a full-stack web application that allows users to:  

**Book Management:** Librarians can add, update, and delete books, categorize them (e.g., fiction, non-fiction, science, history).  

**User Management:** Users can register, log in, and manage their accounts. Librarians can track active and overdue loans.  

**Borrowing System:** Users can borrow and return books, view their borrowing history, and receive due-date reminders.  

**Visual Insights:** The app provides charts and graphs (e.g., pie chart for book categories and bar chart for monthly borrowing trends).  

**User Authentication:** Secure login and signup system allowing users to create an account, log in, and manage their activities securely. Only authenticated users can borrow books.
